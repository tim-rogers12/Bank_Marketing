Analysis of Bank Marketing Data

Data for this analysis can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing

This analysis was a regression analysis done for part of the data science program at Bellevue University. The constraints of the project were to clean and analyze the data using the model of our choice. The conclusion was that I created an effective model but was unable to determine factor importance. 

This was early on in the program and there are several approaches that I could have taken differently. Firstly, I could have broken down the model into categories based on what I wanted to analyze rather than entering all features into the model and analyzing the p-values. Second, I could have used a Random Forest model. Using a Random Forest model is a more straight forward way to model factor importance than a Logistic Regression. Overall, the model was executed well as was the smote sampling model.
